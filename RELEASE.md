# Open Cluster Management (OCM) Releases

This document provides an overview of the release cadence, versioning strategy, and community involvement for the Open Cluster Management (OCM) project.

## Versioning

OCM follows the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/), which uses a version number format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. This approach ensures that version numbers convey meaning about the underlying changes.

## Release Cadence

### Major Releases

The OCM major releases happen when the project has reached a maturity level where we are ready to move forward. These releases are less frequent and require thorough planning to ensure a smooth transition for users. Major releases are communicated well in advance to allow the community to prepare for any necessary adjustments.

For example, in preparation for the upcoming v1.0.0 release, we are gathering all tasks, improvements, documentation, and final checks needed before the release. Community members are encouraged to contribute their ideas and suggestions. For more details please visit the [v1.0.0 Release Preparation issue](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/ocm/issues/832).

### Minor Releases

The OCM minor releases currently happen approximately four times per year. The minor releases generally covers all the components of OCM to provide developers and users a consistent OCM experience.

### Patch Releases

The OCM patch release is expected to happen approximately a month after a minor release. Not all components are expected to have a patch release. Each component will perform a patch release based on the number of fixes needed from the community.

Additional patch release for components might happen prior to another minor release if there are critical security vunlerabiltiies fixes and/or demand from the community.

## Release Process

1. **Planning**: The release planning involves community discussions to identify the features and fixes to be included in the upcoming release. Community members are encouraged to participate in planning sessions, contribute code, and provide feedback on releases. 
2. **Development**: Contributors work on the identified features and fixes, ensuring they adhere to the project's coding standards and guidelines.
3. **Release**: The release is tagged in the version control system, and release notes are published to inform the community about the changes.
